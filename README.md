# Ki_predict

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for predicting the inhibition constant (**Ki**) from binding free energy values (**ΔG**).  

The goal is to provide a simple and practical tool for estimating ligand affinity in computational chemistry and molecular docking studies.

## Contents
- `kipredicted.ipynb` → Notebook with the Ki calculation script.

## Usage
Open the notebook in **Jupyter Lab** or **Jupyter Notebook**, set the ΔG value, and run the cells to obtain the estimated Ki.
